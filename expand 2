2. Read for pleasure and personal connection (extensive reading).

4. Write a reflective paragraph connecting the story to their own experiences.
5. Apply pre writing, writing, and post writing activities as part of the writing process.

   

 Lesson Outline

 1. Warm up and Objective Discussion (10 minutes)
  Warm up Activity (7 mins):  
  Ask: “What’s the most meaningful gift you’ve ever given or received?”  
  Students pair up and share, then volunteers share with the class.

  Objective Discussion (3 mins):  
  Write objectives on the board. Explain the focus on reading types and the writing process (pre writing, writing, post writing).

   

 2. Pre Writing Activity: Brainstorming Sacrifice & Gifts (10 minutes)
  Activity:  
  On the board, write “Sacrifice” and “Meaningful Gifts.”  
  Students brainstorm words, feelings, or experiences related to these themes in pairs or small groups.  
  Prompt: “Think of a time you or someone you know sacrificed something, or received/gave a meaningful gift. List words, feelings, and questions that come to mind.”  
  Groups add ideas to the shared list on the board.
  Purpose:  
  Activates prior knowledge, builds vocabulary, and prepares students to connect personally to the story.

   

 3. Instruct and Model (10 minutes)
  Skimming and Scanning:  
    Skim Paragraphs 1–2 for Della’s financial/emotional state.
    Scan for the exact amount of money.
    Listen to the audio and underline key words.
    Pair discussion: “What do we know about Della so far?”
  Prediction Writing:  
  Individually, students write one sentence: “What do you think will happen next?”  
  (This connects pre writing to initial drafting.)

   

 4. Guided Practice (10 minutes)
  Reading: Skim Paragraphs 6–9 for action; scan for what Della sells and why.
  Listening: Play audio, students check answers.
  Speaking: Group discussion: “Would you do what Della did? Why or why not?”
  Writing Activity:  
  Each student writes a summary (3–4 sentences) of what happened so far, using their brainstorm or prediction as a starting point.  
  Emphasize that drafting is recursive—students may revisit or revise their ideas from the pre writing exercise.

   

 5. Writing Activity: Personal Reflection Draft (10 minutes)
  Prompt:  
  “Have you ever made a sacrifice for someone you love? How did it feel? Connect your experience to Della or Jim’s actions.”
  Instructions:  
  Using ideas from the brainstorm (pre writing), students write a reflective paragraph.  
  Remind students this is a draft—they can cross out, reword, or reorder as they write (recursion in writing).  
  Encourage appropriation: It’s okay to borrow a phrase or structure from the story if it helps express their own ideas.

   

 6. Post Writing Activity: Peer Review & Revision (7 minutes)
  Peer Review:  
  Students exchange drafts with a partner. Each gives feedback using two guiding questions:  
  1. What is clear and strong in your partner’s paragraph?
  2. What could be clearer, or what would you like to know more about?
  Revision:  
  Students revise at least one sentence based on feedback.
  Brief Reflection:  
  “What did you change in your paragraph after feedback? Why?”

        

 7. Conclusion & Next Steps (3 minutes)
  Invite a few students to share what they learned about sacrifice, gifts, or the writing process.
  Collect reflective paragraphs (optional) for assessment.

    Evaluated for clarity, depth of reflection, and personal connection to the story  
    Assessed on organization (topic sentence, supporting ideas, conclusion), use of vocabulary, and appropriate grammar  
    Evidence of the writing process: use of brainstorming/pre writing, drafting, peer feedback, and revision  
    Appropriation: Integration of phrases or ideas inspired by the story

Speaking:  
  Participation in Group and Pair Discussions:  
    Observed for active engagement, relevance of contributions, and ability to connect story themes to personal experience  
    Use of target vocabulary and clear communication  
    Willingness to give and receive peer feedback during post writing

    Students answer 2 questions based on audio clips (e.g., identifying key words, main events)  
    Ability to follow the story and recognize the twist ending  
    Checks for understanding through targeted listening tasks

Holistic Assessment:  
  Rubric based evaluation combining all four skills (R, W, S, L)  
  Emphasis on process as well as product:  
    Did the student engage with each stage of the writing process?  
    Did the student show growth or risk taking in connecting personal experience to literature?  
    Was the student respectful and constructive in peer review?

Feedback:  
  Teacher provides written or oral feedback on reflective writing  
  Peer feedback is integrated to encourage revision and deeper learning  
  Students complete a short self assessment:  
    What did I do well?  
    What will I improve next time?
